### Getting Started [2]

The chapter 2 of [2] is a "warm up" for algorithms, before begin the "real" study. It starts explaining the **Insertion Sort** algorithm, that may be the best solution when the input is little. The file `insertion_sort.c` contains an implementation.

- A **loop invariant** is a condition that is necessarily true immediately before and immediately after each iteration of a loop. In the insertion sort example, the sorted subarray *A[1..j - 1]* contains the same elements it had before the sorting (in different order). So, the subarray always contains the same elements, and is a loop invariant.
